                                            ---- RULES ----

There are two players in a game. Each player has two dice that roll at the same time, and player 1 starts first.

The player pressed the roll dice button, and the sum of the dice are added to the round score in the box that says 'current'.

When the player is done with the round, they can press hold to add the round score to the player score.


If the player rolls a 1 on either die, the round score is reset to zero, and the next player takes their turn.

If the player rolls two 6s, the current score  AND the global score are both set to zero, and the next player takes their turn.

The user can set their own winning score at the bottom or leave it blank. If the user score is blank, the winning score is automatically set to 100.
